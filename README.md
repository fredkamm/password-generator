# password-generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The goal in the project was to create a functioning password generator that meets the users criteria.
- I helped build this site because a random password generator that includes upper and lower case letters, special characters and numbers. giving the user a password to user for various accounts makes it almost impossible for someone to hack into their accounts.
- The problem with the app orginally was that it was not generating a password at all. Currently it is not working to the acceptable standards but it is generating a password at the moment.
- The one thing i learned is that javascript is not easy and it an important piece to making sure your site is running successfully.


## Usage

The way to use this site correctly would be to have the user enter in the desired about of character they would like in their password. Then they will be asked if they would like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. the users input will then be logged so that the password generated will meet the users criteria. after the user answers all the prompts they will be asked to click the 'generate password' button which will then display the password that meets the users criteria.
